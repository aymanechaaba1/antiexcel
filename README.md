> [!IMPORTANT]
> I didn't provide any url yet because there is a bug either in shadcn or nextjs or both that caused the deployment to fail, all my code is working fine on the development but the file upload triggers a bug and that's something that needs to be fixed, once it gets fixed, my project will be live on the internet.

1. `npm i`
2. Setup your env variables
3. `npm run dev`

This will run the development server on <mark>http://localhost:443</mark> (443 and not 3000 because Paypal requires that).

📍 For Paypal API, make sure you add a webhook url using ngrok, I've tried the new NextJS feature to use https localhost but Paypal didn't accept that.
